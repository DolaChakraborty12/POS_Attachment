# 📚 Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging Using BERT

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the BanglaBERT model for Parts of Speech (POS) tagging on a provided dataset using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The goal is to develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load, clean, and tokenize the raw dataset.
2. **Model Development**: Fine-tune the pre-trained BanglaBERT model for POS tagging.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on various metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score).
4. **Classification Report**: Generates a detailed report for model evaluation.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Numpy
